ActsAsArchivable
================

ActsAsArchivable is a collection of methods that I found myself using quite a bit related 
to models with time-stamped columns.  Initial things were blog entries in regards to archives, 
but I found that I was using these more and more in various ways throughout many models.

This library requires ActiveRecord.
